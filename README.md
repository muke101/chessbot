This program is an attempt at building a chess engine and bot to play against all from scratch in Python. It uses is a straight forward approach of mapping the board onto a matrix and implementing the rules of movement from there.

Currently the engine is fully implemented, so now an interface needs to be made for the bot to work off of, and then finally the bot itself. I don't aim for it to be anything super competetive, just something that could hold a game against you.

Below are examples of movements being made as well as illegal moves attempted. As the engine is implemented, it would be possible to play a full game of chess with another person if you both shared the same keyboard.
